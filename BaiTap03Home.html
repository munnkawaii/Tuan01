            <p><span style="color: brown">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the
                Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on
                rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have
                gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
             <p>I've started putting up a <a href="BaiTap03Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the
                production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
                If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please 
                contact me.</p>
